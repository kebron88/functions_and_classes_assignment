Complete this assignment by filling in the functions (question 1 through 10) and the classes, (class1 and class2) and pushing your work back to your forked repository. You should test out your completed functions and classes by running each program (eg. running "python question1.py"). If your result matches with the expected result from the test case, you will receive a message saying that the test case passed.
